# COMBO-MF

COMBO-MF is provided as a command line tool that can be deployed as a 
standalone executable on Windows machines. Download and install the
Windows version of MATLAB Runtime for R2019b from the following link:

## Intra-plate analysis

- One prototype 

The following short animation shows how to deploy the computational
module COMBO-MF, in order to perform intra-plate analysis and
visualizatio using one prototypic object, manually extracted 
from the phase-contrast image libraries.

- Merge results from all prototypes

The following short animation shows how to deploy the computational 
module COMBO-MF, in order to merge and visualize all intra-plate 
analysis results obtained using all different prototypes.

## Inter-plate analysis

The following short animation shows how to deploy the computational 
module COMBO-MF, in order to perform inter-plate analysis. This involves
quality control of the replicate results among the different plates,
calculation of the corresponding median values to reduce experimental 
noise/variability and joint visualization.
